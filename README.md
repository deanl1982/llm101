# AI-101: Understanding Large Language Models

A comprehensive introduction to how LLMs actually work - from the history of AI to the transformer architecture that powers modern models like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini.

## Overview

Before we automate our workflows with AI agents, it's critical to understand what's under the hood. This talk provides a technical foundation for understanding Large Language Models (LLMs) - how they're built, how they learn, and crucially, what their limitations are.

## What's in This Repository

This repository contains materials and interactive demos for a community talk on Large Language Models:

### Presentation Materials
- **[llm101.pptx](llm101.pptx)** - Main presentation slides covering LLM fundamentals

### Interactive Demos
- **[bingo.html](bingo.html)** - Interactive AI terminology bingo game for audience engagement
  - Features 12 essential AI/ML terms (Machine Learning, Neural Network, Transformer, etc.)
  - Participants click terms as they're mentioned during the talk
  - Celebratory confetti animation when complete
  - Works locally (just open in browser) or can be deployed to Azure

### Code Examples
- **[weights-lakes.py](weights-lakes.py)** - Weight calculation examples for neural networks
- **[weights-csotm-before-after.py](weights-csotm-before-after.py)** - Before/after weight comparison examples
- **[sample-frankenstein.txt](sample-frankenstein.txt)** - Sample text for NLP/tokenization demonstrations

### Visual Assets
- **[whey-ai-man-banner-middle.png](whey-ai-man-banner-middle.png)** - Banner graphic for the presentation

## Quick Start

### Using the Bingo Game
